            <p>
              Libraries are wonderful community spaces, and do their best to
              reflect their communities. Permanently childless adults make up
              a significant part of the community, with specific needs for their
              libraries.
            </p>
            <h2>How many people are childless?</h2>
            <p>
              Childlessness is a taboo issue that doesn't get a lot of public
              attention, so most people don't know how prevalent it is.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the UK, USA, Canada and Australia, 1 in 5 women, or 20%, reach
              the age of 45 without children. The numbers are less clear for
              men and non-binary people, but are likely to be similar.
            </p>
            <p>
              Given only around 2% of women are childfree-by-choice, that means
              that 18% of women over 45 are childless - they wanted to have
              children but did not get to. This could be because they didn't meet
              a willing partner in time, had infertility, were too unwell to
              carry a pregnancy or raise a child, had a partner they couldn't
              safely or healthily raise a child with, could not afford IVF or
              to raise a child alone, or hundreds of other reasons.
            </p>
            <h2>What does childlessness have to do with libraries?</h2>
            <p><b>Resources</b></p>
            <p>
              As information hubs, libraries are a resource. Unplanned
              childlessness can cause depression, grief, and confusion as
              someone grapples with what happened and makes a new plan for
              their life.
            </p>
            <p><b>Inclusion</b></p>
            <p>
              Seeing yourself reflected in books is important - libraries
              usually seek to reflect the languages, cultures and other
              identities of their community. This impacts the books on the
              shelves, book labeling, displays and celebrations. As a somewhat
              hidden identity, childlessness needs active inclusion efforts.
            </p>
            <p><b>Safe and comfortable entertainment</b></p>
            <p>
              While grieving, or struggling through treatment for infertility,
              some topics can be especially triggering for childless people.
              Pregnancy, birth, miscarriage and related plot lines can be
              troubling, for example, and in particular the "miracle-baby" trope
              featured in a lot of romances.
            </p>
            <p>
              Repeatedly finding a book suddenly turns to these topics can lead
              to people avoiding reading while they're struggling with deep grief.
            </p>
            <h2>How can libraries support childless people in their communities?</h2>
            <p><b>
              1. Have resources for people who are struggling with childlessness
            </b></p>
            <p>
              To support these members of the community, libraries should stock
              a range of self-help and non-fiction titles to help childless
              people manage the transition into accepting permanent childlessness.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are lists of relevant <a href="self_help.html">self-help</a>
              and <a href="non_fiction.html">non-fiction</a> titles on this site.
            </p>
            <p><b>2. Stock books about childless and childfree people</b></p>
            <p>
              This site includes a list of <a href="fiction.html">fiction</a>
              titles that feature childless or childfree protagonists.
              There are also lists of <a href="biography.html">biography and memoir</a>
              titles written by or about non-parents, so people can find
              something diverting or inspiring that also makes them feel seen.
            </p>
            <p><b>3. Celebrate world childless week</b></p>
            <p>
              If your library celebrates days or months of significance, like
              Pride, Black History Month and Mothers Day, consider also
              celebrating World Childless Week in the same way.
            </p>
            <p>
              You could make a book display of relevant titles, or have posters
              or other resources.
            </p>
            <p><b>4. Be able to recommend books to people trying to avoid triggers</b></p>
            <p>
              All the books featured on this site have been recommended by
              childless people, and either feature childless or childfree
              protagonists, or have little-to-no mention of parenting. You can
              use these lists as you like, or create your own!
            </p>
            <p>
              If you use spine labels to draw attention to books for the LGBTIQ
              community, communities of colour and others, consider doing the
              same for books about explicity childless or childfree people.
