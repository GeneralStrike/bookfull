            In this straight-shooting, exhaustively researched book, women
            without kids talk candidly about the ways in which their lives differ
            from societal norms and expectations--the good, the bad, and the unexpected.

            From celebrity and news websites to streaming and social content to
            lifestyle blogs, family-building successes are routinely and
            glowingly shared and celebrated. But where are the voices of those
            who are unable to have children? Silent Sorority offers an
            unflinching and insightful look at what it's like to be barren in
            an era of designer babies and helicopter parents.

            Somewhere out beyond the edge of the universe there is a library
            that contains an infinite number of books, each one the story of
            another reality. One tells the story of your life as it is, along
            with another book for the other life you could have lived if you
            had made a different choice at any point in your life. While we all
            wonder how our lives might have been, what if you had the chance to
            go to the library and see for yourself? Would any of these other
            lives truly be better?

            After a decade of trying and failing to become a mother, Jessica
            Hepburn knew it was time to do something different. So she decided
            to swim twenty-one miles across the English Channel -- no easy feat,
            especially for someone who couldn't swim very well. As the punishing
            training schedule commenced, Jessica learned you need to put on
            weight to stave off the cold. This gave her the idea to meet and
            eat with a collection of inspiring women, and ask them: does
            motherhood make you happy?
          </p><p>
            From baronesses and professors to award-winners and record-breakers,
            each of the women had compelling truths to tell about fulfillment
            and the meaning of motherhood.

            Like many women, Sian Prior arrived at the point where she was ready
            to start having babies—and found they were not hers to have. Three
            miscarriages with a supportive partner; a new partner who already
            had all the children he wanted; step-children; step-grandchildren;
            the decision to parent solo, followed by many rounds of fertility
            treatments. After all this Sian found herself, at fifty, childless
            and coming to terms. Weighing up the freedoms against the losses.
            Compelling, moving, beautifully written and unexpectedly uplifting,
            Childless is her story.

            intelligent, deeply intimate, lyrical reflections on the life of a
            woman who stands on the threshold between two millennia. Both
            manifesto and confession, this moving memoir explores the meaning
            and purpose Donna Ward discovered in a life lived entirely without
            a partner and children.
